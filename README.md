All The APIs are working as expected , I am using the "https://api.thenewsapi.com/" for news. and DB is MYSQL. In db I have created the schema "airtribe" and table name as "userinfo" with columns id(auto generated),name,password(encoded),username,preferred_category. I am retrunign the fetched news as string for time being. I have managed to check if user is not present / not set preferences error handling and returning appropriate responses.
